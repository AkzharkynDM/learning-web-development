A simple web application to learn web development. 

# Web-development path

Below is the suggestion for a curriculum that a person can follow to get to start with web development. 

## Simple first steps 
Designs, templates, frameworks. Creation of static pages.
Client-server architecture
Now you can make this page dynamic, e.g. store info in a DB (in-memory DBs, e.g., Sqlite). Here you can introduce backend development, and popular frameworks.
Requests and how frontend and backend can communicate.
Once you can run client and server locally.
Once you are done with this foundation, you can dig into adding a bit more functionality to your project. Here a person can adapt TDD and learn about unit testing.
Now the person can think about version control systems and development in a team. Create a Github/GiLab/Bitbucket repo and push the code there.
Use free Continuous Integration (CI) tools, e.g., Travis CI
We can enhance the website with more functionality.
Now you can start thinking about where websites are hosted on. What is the domain? 
Look at cloud providers. What is cloud computing (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). I can recommend Heroku PaaS.
What is the Continouos Deployment (CD)? 
Once we can host the website on a cloud provider, think about creating a log in page for users.
Once we have this log in / sign up page, the person can start digging into auth*, storing user credentials, input validations and sanitizations, SQL injections, security issues

**As the result, a person can have a simple website deployed on Heroku.** 

## More advanced topics
Next a person can start thinking of more advanced topics:
In memory DB vs on disk.
MVC (model-view-controller)
What is the protocol? What is the difference between HTTP/HTTPS? What is the certificate?
REST API, stateful services vs stateless
Computer networks, OSI model.
Optimization of code, design patterns, clean code
Package structure, build tools 
Docker
Kubernetes
Monolith vs Microservice architecture 
Security
